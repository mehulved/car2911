## Car2911
The journey started with a want to get a fuel efficient car for my office commute as the old ICE car was giving an extremely poor economy of 3-5 kmpl for  the dreaded HSR-Indiranagar and return route.
Idea was to get the cheapest possible car that fits the criteria. Initially, the Hyundais and Marutis were in the list including "Espresso"(guess why?).
But, this being the first car in my name, I wanted to be a bit forward looking and go with the promise of EV. These are early days but the EV technology seems to have come a long way forward where there are affordable EVs to consider. There were, undoubtedly innumerable questions on EV being the right choice. I spent hours researching and understanding the current landscape in India and felt that it is practically a no-brainer for office and back commute, with no additional risk over an ICE car.
As I wanted to keep the budget under 10L as I am still not sure how things will pan out and don't want to get stuck with a massive bad investment. This narrowed down my choice to
* Tata Tiago EV
* MG Comet EV
MG Comet did impress me more than I had imagined but Tata Tiago simply won in the fact that it offers a lot more space so I can carry my bicycle in the car.
Thus, began the journey with Car2911. And the journeys don't necessarily go to a plan. Even in thhe early days, what was supposed to be a purchase for local commute has turned into an adventurous companion. More on this in the blog.
